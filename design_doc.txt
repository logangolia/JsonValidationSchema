COMP 318 OwlDB Design Project
Summary of project file:
We are creating a database that will store files. These are JSON values whose contents must be stored as type []byte in Go. These
values can be nested arbitraily deeply. There are multiple checks we have to make before and after on the user as they operate in
the database.

We have the schema that will check the documents for formatting inside the repository, which we must use.

[Will add as we go on. I wanna keep focus on one thing at a time but I will keep in mind the overall structure of the program]

For this check-in, we only need to be able to put and store the documents and retrive them from the top level. Thus, right now,
I would focus on the functions, and then after the functions are working, we can add another private response function and write
the HTTP codes.

PUT should store each piece of data as a struct. This means it has to be recursive, so if we can do that up front instead of just
be only able to read in the database and a document one level deep then PUT and GET for paths will be simple.

GET, on the other hand, must stay concurrent with the files in the database. This means that at least for the check-in, we should be
able to PUT something in the database, get it, and repeat with different files and the same result.


Overall, PUT and GET should operate on the database struct, which should look something like this:

type database struct {
    createdBy string      (username)
    createdAt string      (timestamp)
    lastModifiedBy string (username)
    lastModifiedAt string (timestamp)
    //database contents
}

func (d database) put(){
    //recursive work structure
    //response indicating success
}

func (d database) get(){
    //work
    //response indicating success and the file name if successful	
}

We must use visitor patterns to access files.

1.	type visitor interface {
2.	accessFile(JSONdoc)
3.	}
4.	
5.	func accept(v visitor)
6.	
7.	func (obj *JSONdoc) accept(v visitor){
8.	v.accessFile(obj)
9.	}

Create working operations, then add authentication for PUT.

Here is the form for path structure required by the check-in. Note that eventually we will have to deal
with paths that look like /v1/{database}/{doc1}/{doc2}/{doc3}/.

PUT /v1/{database}
GET /v1/{database}/

For these functions, we only need to support a document name, not a document path.
PUT /v1/{database}/{documentName}
GET /v1/{database}/{documentName}
